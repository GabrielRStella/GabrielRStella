        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning offers a promising path towards the creation of intelligent agents, but state-of-the-art methods are woefully incapable when compared to even simple biological organisms. One of the reasons for this is the lack of <i>object-based, compositional reasoning</i> in deep-learning systems. In this project, we use the principle of object-oriented (i.e., <i>relational</i>) reasoning to design algorithms that learn and act more effectively.",

        "title": "External-Memory Streaming",
        "abstract": "Interaction with external-memory devices, such as hard disk drives (HDDs), is a significant challenge for modern applications due to the large delays incurred by random access. In this project, we develop and study a new model for external-memory applications called <i>bowtie streaming</i>. Our optimized I/O scheduling algorithms are able to maintain throughputs several times higher than the fastest prior methods.",
