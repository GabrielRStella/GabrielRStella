        "abstract": "Interaction with external-memory devices, such as hard disk drives (HDDs), is a significant challenge for modern applications due to the large delays incurred by random access. In this project, we develop and study a new model for external-memory applications called <i>bowtie streaming</i>. Our optimized I/O scheduling algorithms are able to maintain throughputs several times higher than the fastest prior methods.",
